# Hi there, I’m Preston Lyons

I am a junior **Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University** with a growing focus on **software development, web systems, and creative technology design**.  
I am passionate about building tools that blend accessibility, efficiency, and interactivity, whether that involves a learning platform, a productivity tool, or a game prototype.

### AWS x INRIX 24-Hour Hackathon
**Highview Student Management System**: A full-stack platform for tracking attendance and engagement with role-based access, session creation, a three-tier points system, task workflows, and automated outreach for at-risk students. Built with Next.js 16 (React 19, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS 4 and Radix UI, PostgreSQL on AWS RDS, secure cookie sessions with bcrypt, Recharts for analytics, and the Resend API for email.

### YC Agent Jam
**Inkwell**: A study tool that turns long PDFs and docs into concise notes with an option for realistic handwritten rendering. Documents are uploaded through a Next.js frontend, parsed to clean markdown via OCR and layout analysis, then routed to a chat and notes workflow with full-document context. A Python FastAPI service can generate typed notes or a PNG of handwritten notes from a custom model.

### YC Agentic Payments Hackathon

**Company Spending Manager**: An AI-assisted expense and payments system with a conversational interface. Invoices from PDFs or images are parsed into structured data, categorized, and stored in SQLite. A chat agent can list, create, update, and pay expenses, orchestrating multiple tools in parallel. The stack uses Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion, with Claude handling extraction and multi-tool routing. Supports USDC payouts via tool integration.

## Technical Focus

I am most comfortable in **JavaScript** and **Python**, and currently expanding my skills in **C/C++** and **C#** to strengthen my systems and game development foundations.  
I am especially interested in scalable software systems, user-centered design, and exploring how automation and interactivity can make complex technology more approachable.
