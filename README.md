# Hi there, I’m Preston Lyons

I am a junior **Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University** with a growing focus on **software development, web systems, and creative technology design**.  
I am passionate about building tools that blend accessibility, efficiency, and interactivity, whether that involves a learning platform, a productivity tool, or a game prototype.

### YC Agent Jam
Currently developing a web platform powered by intelligent file-processing agents that can parse and process any text-based file (PPTX, DOCX, PDF, and others), extract text from images, and allow users to download clean `.txt` data or generate summaries, answers, and student-style handwritten notes using a fine-tuned model.

## Technical Focus

I am most comfortable in **JavaScript** and **Python**, and currently expanding my skills in **C/C++** and **C#** to strengthen my systems and game development foundations.  
I am especially interested in scalable software systems, user-centered design, and exploring how automation and interactivity can make complex technology more approachable.
