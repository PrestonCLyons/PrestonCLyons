## Hi there 👋

I am a junior Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University with a growing focus on software development, web systems, and creative technology design. I am passionate about building tools that blend accessibility, efficiency, and interactivity, whether that involves a learning platform, a productivity tool, or a game prototype.

I have participated in multiple hackathons and startup-oriented builds, including:

Roblox Game Jam – Void Escape, a physics-based platformer using Lua and custom gameplay mechanics.

NVIDIA World’s Shortest Hackathon – Excused.ai, a platform that converts videos and files into structured notes and interactive Q&A. The full version integrates Auth0, Stripe, and usage-based payment plans for scalable SaaS deployment.

AWS x INRIX 24-Hour Hackathon – An enterprise-grade management site built with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Bedrock, automating database access through natural language queries.

YC Agent Jam – Currently developing a web platform powered by intelligent file-processing agents that can parse and process any text-based file (PPTX, DOCX, PDF, and others), extract text from images, and allow users to download clean .txt data or generate summaries, answers, and student-style handwritten notes using a fine-tuned model.

I am most comfortable in JavaScript and Python, and currently expanding my skills in C/C++ and C# to strengthen my systems and game development foundations. I am especially interested in scalable software systems, user-centered design, and exploring how automation and interactivity can make complex technology more approachable.
